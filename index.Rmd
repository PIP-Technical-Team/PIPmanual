# Prerequisites {-}

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```


You need to make sure the `bookdown` package is installed in your computer
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bookdown")

# or the development version
 devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.
