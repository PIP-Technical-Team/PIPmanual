        "> The **PRIMUS** system is designed to facilitate this process of generating internal estimates of the World Bank's poverty indicators and reduce the time needed for resolving discrepancies. It is a workflow management platform for the submission, review and approval of poverty estimates and a tracking facility to capture the inputs and results of the estimation process for future reference and audits.\n",

As long as you're connected to the intranet it should work fine.

That is, if one particular dataset is uploaded more than once, it will get two different transaction IDs. When communicating with the Poverty GP, you should refer to the transaction ID rather than the survey (or at least both) because the same country/year, you might have two different transactions.\n",

Since annual meetings take place around September, `pcn` assumes you are interested in the estimates for the Spring-meetings release, around March next year. Thus, it will filter the results from `primus`, keeping only those transactions that were uploaded from November 2020. Now it is likely that the PRIMUS system has not been opened for uploading new data in November, as it usually opens around December and July.
