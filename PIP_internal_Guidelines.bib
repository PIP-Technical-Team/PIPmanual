In addition, the coverage rules for reporting regional and global poverty aggregates have been reviewed, resulting in small adjustments. Historical regional and global aggregates are now reported with an annual frequency instead of intervals with varying lengths. Only two surveys have been added and some welfare aggregates have been revised compared with the March 2020 update. National accounts and population input data have been updated. This document explains these changes and the rationale behind them in detail. The data and associated estimates are used for the analysis of global poverty in the forthcoming Poverty and Shared Prosperity Report 2020.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces some relatively straightforward computational tools for estimating poverty measures from the sort of data that are typically available from published sources. All that is required for using these tools is an elementary regression package. The methodology also easily lends itself to a number of poverty simulations, some of which are discussed. The paper addresses the central question: How do we construct poverty measures from grouped data on consumption and income? Two broad approaches can be identified: simple interpolation methods and methods based on parameterized Lorenz curves. The paper briefly describes the two approaches and discusses why the second may be considered preferable.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses three questions: 1) what would have been the growth and income trajectory of Syria in the absence of war; 2) given the war, what explains the reduction in economic growth in terms physical capital, labor force, human capital, and productivity; and 3) what potential growth scenarios for Syria there could be in the aftermath of war. Estimates of the impact of conflict point to negative gross domestic product (GDP) growth of -12 percent on average over 2011-18, resulting in a GDP contraction to about one-third of the 2010 level. In post-conflict simulation scenarios, the growth drivers are affected by the assumed levels of reconstruction assistance, repatriation of refugees, and productivity improvements associated with three plausible political settlement outcomes: a baseline (Sochi-plus) moderate scenario, an optimistic (robust political settlement) scenario, and a pessimistic (de facto balance of power) scenario. Respectively for these scenarios, GDP per capita average growth in the next two decades is projected to be 6.1, 8.2, or 3.1 percent, assuming that a final and stable resolution of the conflict is achieved.},

With extreme limitations on information, the findings of the paper are subject to an extraordinary degree of uncertainty. The key messages are: (1) that the devastating civil war has set the country back decades in terms of economic, social and human development. Syria’s GDP today is less than half of what it was before the war started and it could take two decades or more for Syria to return to its pre-conflict GDP levels; and that (2) while reconstructing damaged physical infrastructure will be a monumental task, rebuilding Syria’s human and social capital will be an even greater and lasting challenge.},
