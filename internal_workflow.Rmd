# Internal Workflow

This chapter explains the internal technical workflow of the PIP project. Many
of the different steps of the workflow are explained in more detail in other
chapters of this book. This chapter, however, presents an overview of the
workflow and its components.

## The Github group

The technical code of the PIP project is organized in Git repositories in the
Github group [/PIP-Technical-Team](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team). You
need to be granted collaborator status in order to contribute to any of the
repositories in the group. Also, many of the repositories do not play a direct
role in the PIP technical workflow. Some of them are intended for documenting
parts of the workflow or for testing purposes. For example, the repository of
this book--[/PIPmanual](https://github.com/PIP-Technical-Team/PIPmanual)--is not
part of the workflow of PIP, since it is not necessary for any estimation. Yet,
you need get familiar with all the repositories in case you need to make a
contribution in any of them. In this chapter, however, we will focus on
understanding the repositories that affect directly the PIP workflow.

First, we will see the overview of the workflow. It is an overview because each
bucket of its buckets is a workflow in itself. Yet, it is important to have the
overview clear in order to understand how and where all the pieces fall
together. Then, we will unpack each of the workflow buckets to understand them
in more detail.

## Overview

The workflow overview is mainly composed of four steps.

1.  Data acquisition
2.  Data preparation
3.  pre-calculated indicators
4.  API feeding

Each of the steps (or buckets) is prerequisite of the next one, so if something
changes in one of the them, it is necessary to execute the subsequent steps.

## Data acquisition

Before understanding how the input data of PIP is acquired, we need to
understand PIP data itself. The PIP is fed by two kind of data: welfare data and
auxiliary data.
